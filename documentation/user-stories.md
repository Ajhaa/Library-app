# My thoughts and what is missing?
To summarize, a lot was is missing. I was too ambitious with the original planning of this project. Combined with the fact that I didn't focus enough on the project, I'm pretty disapointed in it.  
The genre system completely failed, and will not be as fleshed out as I would like it to be. Also missing are a lot of restraints. Users can review or loan a book multiple times.  
The request system was completely scrapped, and other admin priviledges were not implemented.
Users cannot edit or delete their accounts.  
If only I hand focused more on the project, a lot of these could have been implemented.
