## Info
The app is a website for an imaginary e-book library. Users can browse, borrow and review books. Admins can add new books to the collection, and moderate reviews. Books are grouped by author and collections (for example, Harry Potter -series). Books can be searched, and sorted based on different parameters. Currently book has full crud.
